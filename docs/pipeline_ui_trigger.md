# Pipeline Trigger via UI: Design Considerations

## Overview
This document outlines key design considerations for triggering the Protein Analyzer pipeline via a user interface (UI). The solution focuses on a user-friendly experience, robust backend integration, real-time monitoring, and secure, scalable execution.

## Key Points

- **User-Centric Dashboard:**  
  - Intuitive web interface (e.g., using React or Angular) for file uploads, parameter configuration, and status tracking.

- **RESTful API & Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - A backend API (e.g., FastAPI) receives trigger requests.  
  - An asynchronous job queue (e.g., Celery) handles long-running tasks, allowing the UI to remain responsive.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  - Live logs and progress indicators provide immediate feedback.  
  - Notifications inform users of job completion or errors.

- **Scalability & Flexibility:**  
  - Dockerized execution ensures reproducibility and isolation.  
  - A modular design allows for future enhancements like batch processing or scheduling.

- **Error Handling & Recovery:**  
  - Clear error messages and automatic retry mechanisms facilitate troubleshooting.  
  - Transparent reporting guides users in resolving issues.

## Conclusion
A UI-triggered pipeline enhances accessibility and efficiency by combining an intuitive interface with secure, scalable, and robust backend processing. This approach ensures that researchers can easily initiate, monitor, and troubleshoot runs, making the Protein Analyzer a powerful tool for protein structure analysis.
